            <p class="story-paragraph">
                Founded in 2025 by a group of passionate music enthusiasts, Fever Records started as a small collection shared among friends. 
                The goal was simple: to bring rare and beloved albums back into circulation. As word spread, so did our collection. 
                We began sourcing from estate sales, record fairs, and direct contributions from the community, expanding our catalog to cover 
                diverse genres and eras. Today, Fever Records is a hub for both seasoned collectors and newcomers to the vinyl world. 
                We continue to grow, adding new releases and hidden gems while maintaining our commitment to quality.
